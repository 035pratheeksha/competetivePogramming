## Problem

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

## Example 1
```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
```
## Exmple 2
```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```
## Constrains
*    n == height.length
*   2 <= n <= 105
*  0 <= height[i] <= 10
