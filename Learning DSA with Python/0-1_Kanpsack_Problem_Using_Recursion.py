    0-1 Knapsack Problem

    Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W 
    to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. 
    
    In other words, 
    Given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights .
    Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity.
    Find maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. 
    
    0-1 Property: You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item or donâ€™t pick it.

    value[]={60,100,120}    Value of individual item
    weight[]={10,20,30}     Weight of individual item
    W=50                    Maximum allowed weight
    Solution:   220         Max value possible, keeping weight <=50

    Using Recursion:
        Time Complexity: O(2^N)
        Space Complexity: O(1)
